# Visualize Database Model (VDM)

VDM (Visual Database Model) is a valuable tool for creating comprehensive database schemas. It offers a user-friendly interface with drag-and-drop functionality, enabling users to easily add tables, columns, define relationships between tables, and implement constraints. This centralized platform facilitates efficient team collaboration and management of the database structure in one place.

# Why VDM?
